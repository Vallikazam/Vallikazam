Hi, I'm Alinur! 👋
I'm a Software Engineering student at AITU, passionate about coding mobile apps and games. I build Flutter apps like an expense tracker and fitness goal tracker, and I'm diving into game dev with Unity. Excited to grow my skills and contribute to awesome IT projects!
🚀 What I Do

Develop Flutter mobile apps with Dart and SQLite, like an expense tracker with Google Maps API and a fitness goal tracker for workout logging.
Explore Unity game development, building projects like LabirinthCoinChallenge.
Apply Python and Java from coursework to solve problems and build cool projects.
